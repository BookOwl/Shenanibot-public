GREETINGS!
Hello fellow LevelHead streamer. I see you are interested on using this chatbot. Here's a quick guide for you 
to start setting up this Shenanibot. Have fun! If you have any question reggarding this project in specific 
just ask me directly on Discord. I'm jajdp signing out.

GETTING STARTED
Materials:

+Node.js
+Twitch account for streaming
+Twitch account for the bot
+Internet [duh..?]


If you don't know how to run a JS script, that's fine. This quick guide will teach you how to run it in the most simple way. 
You will need to install node.js in order to run the file index.js which contains all the chatbot's logic.

So now, go to https://nodejs.org and download the latest version of the software and install it like any other regular program.

After you have installed it. Download the GitHub project as a zip and extract its files on any location on your PC.

Now you need to locate the file "properties.json". Once you have located it. Just edit it like any .txt file.
You will need to fill those fields with the following information:

-------------INPUT PARAMETERS FOR KSB--------------

LEVEL HEAD DELEGATION KEY
You will need a delegation key from your own LEVELHEAD account with the following permissions:
    -View own and others' Levelhead data (levels, profiles, aliases, etc).
    -View, add, and delete own Levelhead level bookmarks.
After you generated it and copy it, paste it on the following paramenter and make it look like this.
"delegationKeyStreamer" = "abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwxyz";

TWITCH STREAMER CHANNEL NAME
On your own channel https://www.twitch.tv/channelName
get the last part that says "cha!nnelName" and paste it in the following parameter so it looks like this:
"twitchChannel" = "channelName"

TWITCH STREAMER DISPLAYED USERNAME
On your own channel write somethin on the chat and copy your twitch username displayed like this:

TwitchDisplayUserName: hey what's up?

"TwitchDisplayUserName" would be your display UserName then paste it in the following parameter so it looks like this
"TwitchStreamer" = "TwitchDisplayUserName"

TWITCH BOT USERNAME AND PASSWORD
Here's the part where we will need the second twitch account we specified in the MATERIALS section. 
This account will be the account of the bot.
The chatbot will take full control of this twitch account, so you are better just creating a new twitch account just for your bot. 
Please do not use your own streaming account, you've been warned.
Once you have the second twitch account ready. You will need its username (username you use to log in) and OAuth password. 
You can get the OAuth password by going to this link:
https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ and letting the website get permissions for the account you are planning to use as a chatbot.
Once you have this information, just copy and paste it into the "properties.json" file as it's shown:

username: "KommSusserBot",
password: "oauth:bslowihcqdhgb2a62cjm5xfp1424we"



Locate the file index.js inside the Shenanibot project and copy the route to where that file is located.
(Example: C:\My_User\Documents\Shenanibot-public\Shenanibot main\Twitch early access version)

Then open a cmd window (TERMINAL if you are in Linux). We need the cmd window to point to the location where our file index.js is. For that we will use the command cd [route]
(Example: cd C:\My_User\Documents\Shenanibot-public\"Shenanibot main"\"Twitch early access version")
Notice that if your route has a name with an space between words, you will need to encapsule the whole folder name between quotes like it's shown in the example on the folder name "Twitch early access version"

After you are in that route, just execute the following command:

npm init
(This will start a wizard which will ask you for stuff. Just press enter until the wizard stops asking for stuff)

npm install axios
(and wait for it to finish installing)
npm install tmi.js
(and wait for it to finish installing)
node .\index.js

And the cmd window will start showing how does the bot connects to your Twitch channel and greets you with the words "Adun Toridas!"

If you are curious about what you are installing, just google "axios.js library" and "tmi.js library".
The node command is for running the index.js file.

LASTLY!
Feel free to study JavaScript and understand the code behind the shenanibot. Make sure to edit and modify it as much as you need or want. Cheers!

and Shout outs to @aferalsheep for the RumpusApi script... and the BS brothers for such a fantastic game!
